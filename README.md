# Revere

## Overview

Revere is an open source video surveillance system with ONVIF camera support, motion detection, recording, playback and object detection.

## Key Features

- ONVIF camera discovery and management
- Motion detection with AI plugin support
- Continuous recording with non motion pruning.
- RTSP streaming
- Cross-platform (Linux/Windows)
- Full featured API

## Quick Start

The quickest way to try it is the .AppImage version on linux or the portable windows binary version.

### Prerequisites

1) Onvif cameras - Axis cameras are the most compatible. If you want me to get your camera working for you send me one and I'll take a crack at it.
2) A Windows or Linux PC.

### Installation

On Linux, simply run the AppImage. You can set the appimage as a startup application on your linux desktop.
On Windows, unzip the package and run the revere.exe.

### Adding Your First Camera

Onvif discoverable cameras should appear in the Discovered list. Once it appears click Record and follow the instructions. Revere will attempt to stream a little from the camera to measure its bitrate and then allow you to pick a storage file size (with retention estimates) for that stream.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Ubuntu 22.04+ | âœ… Tested | Requires GCC 9+ or Clang 10+ |
| Windows 10/11 | âœ… Tested | Requires Visual Studio 2019 or newer (MSVC v17/2022 recommended) |
| Other Linux | ðŸŸ¡ Should work | Any distribution with C++17 compiler and required dependencies |

## System Requirements

### Minimum
Unknown.

### Recommended
A few streams should be possible on most computers... especially if you're not running a build doing object detection.

### Storage
Storage requirements vary based on number of cameras, resolution, bitrate, and retention period. Revere uses the camera's bitrate to estimate retention when configuring recording. Generally:
- 1080p camera at 2-4 Mbps: ~1-2 GB per hour per camera
- 4K camera at 8-15 Mbps: ~4-7 GB per hour per camera
- Consider SSD for better performance with multiple concurrent recordings

## Camera Compatibility

Revere supports ONVIF-compliant cameras with the following features:
- Automatic camera discovery via ONVIF WS-Discovery
- RTSP video streaming (H.264/H.265)
- Axis cameras are known to be highly compatible
- Most modern IP cameras with ONVIF Profile S/T should work

If you have a camera that doesn't work with Revere, the project maintainer is willing to work with you to add support.

## Technology Stack

**Core Media Processing:**
- **OpenCV** (4.x) - Computer vision, motion detection, and background subtraction
- **GStreamer** (1.0) - Media pipeline framework for RTSP streaming and video processing
- **FFmpeg** (4.x/5.x/6.x) - Video decoding, encoding, and format handling

**AI/ML (Optional):**
- **NCNN** - Neural network inference for AI-based motion detection plugins (YOLOv8)

**User Interface:**
- **ImGui** - Immediate-mode GUI framework
- **GLFW** - Window and input management
- **OpenGL** - Graphics rendering

**Networking & Data:**
- **ONVIF** - IP camera discovery and control
- **SQLite** - Metadata and configuration storage
- **nanots** - Time-series database for recording
- **mbedTLS** - TLS/SSL and cryptography
- **pugixml** - XML parsing for ONVIF communication
