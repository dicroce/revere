## Camera Management

### Discovering Cameras

#### Automatic Discovery (ONVIF)

Revere automatically discovers ONVIF-compliant cameras on your network:

1. Ensure cameras are powered on and connected to the same network
2. Launch Revere - discovery begins automatically
3. Discovered cameras appear in the "Discovered" list
4. Click on a discovered camera to view details
5. Click "Record" to begin configuration
6. Enter camera credentials (username/password)
7. Revere will test the connection and measure the stream bitrate
8. Choose storage file size based on retention estimates
9. Camera begins recording

**Supported Discovery Methods:**
- ONVIF WS-Discovery (multicast on port 3702)
- Automatic profile and stream URI detection

#### Manual Camera Addition

If a camera doesn't appear in discovery, you can add it manually:

**Required Information:**
- Camera IP address or hostname
- RTSP URL (e.g., rtsp://192.168.1.100:554/stream1)
- Username/password for authentication
- Friendly name for the camera

**Note:** Manual addition requires knowing the exact RTSP URL for your camera model. Check your camera's documentation or manufacturer's website.
